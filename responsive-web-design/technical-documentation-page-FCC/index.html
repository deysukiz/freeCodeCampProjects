    <p>CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they are positioned relative to their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around them, their parent container, or the main viewport/window.  The page layout techniques we'll be covering in more detail in this module are</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Normal flow</li>
      <li>The display property</li>
      <li>Flexbox</li>
      <li>Grid</li>
      <li>Floats</li>
      <li>Positioning</li>
      <li>Table layout</li>
      <li>Multiple-column layout</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each technique has its uses, advantages, and disadvantages, and no technique is designed to be used in isolation. By understanding what each method is designed for you will be in a good place to understand which is the best layout tool for each task.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Normal_flow">
    <header><h2>Normal flow</h2></header>
    <p>Normal flow is how the browser lays out HTML pages by default when you do nothing to control page layout. Let's look at a quick HTML example:</p>
    
    <pre>
      <code>
        &lt;p&gt;I love my cat.&lt;/p &gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Buy cat food&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Exercise&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Cheer up friend&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The end!&lt;/p&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>
    <p>By default, the browser will display this code as follows:</p>
    
    <div id="code">
      <p>I love my cat.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Buy cat food</li>
        <li>Exercise</li>
        <li>Cheer up friend</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The end!</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Note here how the HTML is displayed in the exact order in which it appears in the source code, with elements stacked up on top of one another — the first paragraph, followed by the unordered list, followed by the second paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elements that appear one below the other are described as block elements, in contrast to inline elements, which appear one beside the other, like the individual words in a paragraph.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      Note: The direction in which block element contents are laid out is described as the Block Direction. The Block Direction runs vertically in a language such as English, which has a horizontal writing mode. It would run horizontally in any language with a Vertical Writing Mode, such as Japanese. The corresponding Inline Direction is the direction in which inline contents (such as a sentence) would run.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many of the elements on your page the normal flow will create exactly the layout you need, however for more complex layouts you will need to alter this default behavior using some of the tools available to you in CSS. Starting with a well-structured HTML document is very important, as you can then work with the way things are laid out by default rather than fighting against it.
    </p>
    <p>The methods that can change how elements are laid out in CSS are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <code>display</code> property — Standard values such as <code>block</code>, <code>inline</code> or <code>inline-block</code> can change how elements behave in normal flow, for example making a block-level element behave like an inline element (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#block_and_inline_boxes">Types of CSS boxes</a>  for more information). We also have entire layout methods that are switched on via specific <code>display</code> values, for example CSS Grid and Flexbox, which alter how elements inside the element they are set on are laid out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Floats — Applying a <code>float</code> value such as <code>left</code> can cause block level elements to wrap alongside one side of an element, like the way images sometimes have text floating around them in magazine layouts.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <code>position</code> property — Allows you to precisely control the placement of boxes inside other boxes. <code>static</code> positioning is the default in normal flow, but you can cause elements to be laid out differently using other values, for example always fixed to the top of the browser viewport.
      </li>
      <li>
        Table layout — features designed for styling the parts of an HTML table can be used on non-table elements using <code>display: table</code> and associated properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multi-column layout — The Multi-column layout properties can cause the content of a block to layout in columns, as you might see in a newspaper.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="The_display_property">
    <header><h2>The display property</h2></header>
    <p>
      The main methods of achieving page layout in CSS are all values of the <code>display</code> property. This property allows us to change the default way something displays. Everything in normal flow has a value of <code>display</code>, used as the default way that elements they are set on behave. For example, the fact that paragraphs in English display one below the other is due to the fact that they are styled with <code>display: block</code>. If you create a link around some text inside a paragraph, that link remains inline with the rest of the text, and doesn’t break onto a new line. This is because the &lt;a&gt; element is <code>display: inline</code> by default.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can change this default display behavior. For example, the &lt;li&gt; element is <code>display: block</code> by default, meaning that list items display one below the other in our English document. If we change the display value to <code>inline</code> they now display next to each other, as words would do in a sentence. The fact that you can change the value of <code>display</code> for any element means that you can pick HTML elements for their semantic meaning, without being concerned about how they will look. The way they look is something that you can change
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to being able to change the default presentation by turning an item from <code>block</code> to <code>inline</code> and vice versa, there are some bigger layout methods that start out as a value of <code>display</code>. However, when using these, you will generally need to invoke additional properties. The two values most important for our purposes when discussing layout are <code>display: flex</code> and <code>display: grid</code>.
    </p>
  </section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id="Flexbox">
    <header><h2>Flexbox</h2></header>
    <p>
      Flexbox is the short name for the Flexible Box Layout Module, designed to make it easy for us to lay things out in one dimension — either as a row or as a column. To use flexbox, you apply display: flex to the parent element of the elements you want to lay out; all its direct children then become flex items. We can see this in a simple example.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HTML markup below gives us a containing element, with a class of <code>wrapper</code>, inside which are three &lt;div&gt; elements. By default these would display as block elements, below one another, in our English language document.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if we add <code>display: flex</code> to the parent, the three items now arrange themselves into columns. This is due to them becoming flex items and being affected by some initial values that flexbox sets on the flex container. They are displayed in a row, because the initial value of <code>flex-direction</code> set on their parent is <code>row</code>. They all appear to stretch to the height of the tallest item, because the initial value of the <code>align-items</code> property set on their parent is <code>stretch</code>. This means that the items stretch to the height of the flex container, which in this case is defined by the tallest item. The items all line up at the start of the container, leaving any extra space at the end of the row.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        .wrapper {
          display: flex;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <pre>
      <code>
        &lt;div class="wrapper"&gt;
          &lt;div class="box1">One&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div class="box2"&gt;Two&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div class="box3"&gt;Three&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      </code>
    </pre>
    
    <div class="wrapper">
      <div class="box1">One</div>
      <div class="box2">Two</div>
      <div class="box3">Three</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      In addition to the above properties that can be applied to the flex container, there are properties that can be applied to the flex items. These properties, among other things, can change the way that the items flex, enabling them to expand and contract to fit into the available space.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a simple example of this, we can add the <code>flex</code> property to all of our child items, with a value of <code>1</code>. This will cause all of the items to grow and fill the container, rather than leaving space at the end. If there is more space then the items will become wider; if there is less space they will become narrower. In addition, if you add another element to the markup the items will all become smaller to make space for it — they will adjust size to take up the same amount of space, whatever that is.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        .wrapper {
          display: flex;
        }
        
        .wrapper > div {
          flex: 1;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <pre>
      <code>
        &lt;div class="wrapper"&gt;
          &lt;div class="box1">One&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div class="box2"&gt;Two&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div class="box3"&gt;Three&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      </code>
    </pre>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Grid_Layout">
    <header><h2>Grid Layout</h2></header>
    <p>
      While flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layout, Grid Layout is designed for two dimensions — lining things up in rows and columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again, you can switch on Grid Layout with a specific value of display — <code>display: grid</code>. The below example uses similar markup to the flex example, with a container and some child elements. In addition to using <code>display: grid</code>, we are also defining some row and column tracks on the parent using the <code>grid-template-rows</code> and <code>grid-template-columns</code> properties respectively. We've defined three columns each of <code>1fr</code> and two rows of <code>100px</code>. I don’t need to put any rules on the child elements; they are automatically placed into the cells our grid has created.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        .wrapper {
          display: grid;
          grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
          grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
          grid-gap: 10px;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <pre>
      <code>
        &lt;div class="wrapper"&gt;
          &lt;div class="box1">One&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div class="box2"&gt;Two&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div class="box3"&gt;Three&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div class="box4"&gt;Four&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div class="box5"&gt;Five&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div class="box6"&gt;Six&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      </code>
    </pre>
    <div class="wrapper2">
        <div class="box1">One</div>
        <div class="box2">Two</div>
        <div class="box3">Three</div>
        <div class="box4">Four</div>
        <div class="box5">Five</div>
        <div class="box6">Six</div>
