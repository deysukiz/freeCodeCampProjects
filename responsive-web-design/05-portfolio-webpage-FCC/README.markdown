This is my 5th challenge from the [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/) of freeCodeCamp.

Personal portfolio.
This portfolio contains the four projects made in the Responsive Web Design Certification.

For this project, I only use HTML and CSS.

Also I put a svg shape that I got from [getwaves.com](https://getwaves.io/).
